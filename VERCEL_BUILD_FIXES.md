# Vercel Build Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve Vercel deployment issues.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **useSearchParams() without Suspense Boundary**
**Error Message:**
```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/[locale]/programs/[slug]"
```

**Root Cause:** 
- The `ProgressBar` component in `src/app/ProgressBar.tsx` uses `useSearchParams()` 
- It was imported in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` without a Suspense boundary
- This caused errors during server-side rendering

**Fix Applied:**
- Wrapped `<ProgressBar />` in a `<Suspense>` boundary in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

```tsx
import { Suspense } from "react";

<Suspense fallback={null}>
  <ProgressBar />
</Suspense>
```

### 2. **API Fetch Errors During Build (400 Status)**
**Error Message:**
```
Error fetching program: Error: Failed to fetch program: 400
Error in ProgramDetailPage: Error: NEXT_HTTP_ERROR_FALLBACK;404
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `generateStaticParams()` function in `src/app/[locale]/(website)/programs/[slug]/page.tsx` was trying to pre-render pages during build
- It made API calls to fetch program data
- During build time on Vercel, the Supabase connection or environment variables weren't available
- This caused the API to return 400 errors

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `generateStaticParams()` function entirely
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to enable dynamic rendering
- This prevents pre-rendering during build and renders pages on-demand

```tsx
// Use dynamic rendering for this page since we need data from Supabase
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

---

### 3. **Other Pages Using useSearchParams()**
**Pages Affected:**
- `src/app/[locale]/(website)/search-result/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[locale]/(website)/donate/thank-you/page.tsx`

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to both pages
- This ensures they use dynamic rendering and prevents build-time errors

---

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx**
   - Added Suspense wrapper around ProgressBar

2. **src/app/[locale]/(website)/programs/[slug]/page.tsx**
   - Removed `generateStaticParams()` function
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

3. **src/app/[locale]/(website)/search-result/page.tsx**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

4. **src/app/[locale]/(website)/donate/thank-you/page.tsx**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

---

## Verification Steps

After deploying to Vercel, verify:

1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Programs listing page loads: `/en/programs`
3. ✅ Individual program pages load: `/en/programs/[slug]`
4. ✅ Search results page works: `/en/search-result?q=test`
5. ✅ Donation thank you page works: `/en/donate/thank-you`
6. ✅ No 404 or 400 errors in browser console
7. ✅ All data from Supabase loads correctly

---

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
```

## Performance Considerations

### Dynamic Rendering Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ✅ No build-time errors
- ✅ Always fresh data from Supabase
- ✅ Works reliably with environment variables

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Pages render on-demand (slight delay on first load)
- ⚠️ No static optimization benefits

### Recommendations for Future Optimization

1. **Enable ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):**
   ```tsx
   export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour
   ```

2. **Use Static Generation with Supabase Direct Access:**
   - Instead of calling API routes during build, directly query Supabase
   - This requires proper environment variable handling during build

3. **Implement On-Demand Revalidation:**
   - Trigger page rebuilds when content changes in Supabase
   - Use Supabase webhooks → API route → `revalidatePath()`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Vercel Deployment Logs**
   - Watch for any new errors or warnings
   - Check function execution times

2. **Test All Dynamic Pages**
   - Programs listing and detail pages
   - Search functionality
   - Donation flow

3. **Consider Adding Edge Functions**
   - For faster response times globally
   - Especially for API routes
